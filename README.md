# ShareAid
Welcome to the ShareAid project! 

Here is a breakdown of the different folders in this repository:

## photoUI
This is the current demo and front-facing codebase for ShareAid. See the photoUI README for more information about the parts of this code.

## instagram-pulldown (NOW DEFUNCT)
In this folder, find outdated code for pulling photos from Instagram. Note: Instagram's API is currently being decprecated, which is why this code no longer works. See more detail about the Instagram API deprecation [here](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/).

## weblinks
In this folder, find all scripts related to weblinks-specific work. See the README inside for more details on the individual scripts.

## Instagram-Metadata
Currently not used, this is the Instagram portion of the [Sochiatrist](http://sochiatrist.cs.brown.edu/) codebase.
