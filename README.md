# ShareAid
Welcome to the ShareAid project! 

Here is a breakdown of the different folders in this repository:

## photos
The photos arm of ShareAid recommends captioned Instagram posts from a user's camera roll based on what they have posted and written in the past.

## weblinks
The weblinks arm of ShareAid recommends captioned Facebook posts of shared links from other websites by crawling through a user's internet browsing history as well as the links they've shared in the past.

ShareAid is a tool being developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab overseen by Jeff Huang at Brown University. If you have any questions about ShareAid, please contact me (Philip) at [philip_hinch@brown.edu](mailto:philip_hinch@brown.edu).
