The Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya have a series of rites of passage that accompany boys into adulthood. Every 10 or 15 years a new warrior class will be initiated into the tribe. Boys between the ages of 10 and 20 are brought together from all across the country. Dozens of houses are built that will serve as the place of initiation. The night before the ceremony, the boys sleep outside in the forest. At dawn, they return to the little makeshift homestead for a day of singing and dancing.  They drink a mixture of milk, cow’s blood, and alcohol and eat piles and piles of meat. After the festivities, boys who are of age (12-16) are ready to be circumcised. The Emuratare is the most important ceremony in the life of a Maasai boy. Once circumcised, the tribe will consider him a man, warrior, and protector of his village. As the young man makes his way to where the elders will circumcise him, friends and family members will taunt the boy by saying things like “If you flinch, we will disown you.” The Maasai value bravery of their warriors and the circumcision is a boy’s first way to prove his courage in the face of severe pain. It takes about 3 months for the circumcision to heal and during that time the young men wear black clothing and live in huts built by the women of the village. The Maasai boy is now warrior. #maasai #tanzania #child #rite #boys #serengeti #ngorongoro #adulthood","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/23101900_367429720344713_1432485542993330176_n.jpg"},

Filming this sequence with @paulnicklen (seen here filming) & @cristinamittermeier took several hours as we located the bait-ball and patiently waited for the tide to turn. The jacks came in like clockwork and it ended up being one of our favorite moments of the trip. You don't need more than 2 feet of water, mask and a snorkel to experience one of Cuba's best dives.

The highly adaptable honeybee makes its home on every continent in the world, with the exception of Antarctica. This honeybee is lightly dusted with pollen, a result of visiting up to 2,000 flowers per day in the summertime. Honeybees are masters of communication and can alert other bees in their hive of the location of food and other resources by performing a complex movement called the “waggle dance”. The bee will “waggle” its body in relation to the resource’s location using the sun as an orientation point, and will have different movements and speeds for the distance and direction of the food. If the sun changes its location in the time it takes the bee to return to the hive, it knows to account for this change and will still convey correct information to its coworkers. The other workers in the hive read this information and can then work together to bring the resources back to the hive. The language of honeybees is regarded as the most complex and symbolic of all animal communications, and scientists still don’t fully understand the depth of its complexity. Austrian ethologist Karl von Frisch was the first to crack the code of the waggle dance and won the Nobel Prize for this eye-opening discovery in 1973. This little bee’s job is to forage all day, but despite all its hard work, a single honeybee will only produce about 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its entire lifetime. Honey packs a powerful punch, though, as just an ounce of it could fuel a single bee to fly all the way around the world.

Biofluorescent organisms absorb light, transform it, and eject – or “re-emit”–it as a different color.

Males can weigh as much as 100 pounds while females are smaller at around 50-60 pounds.  Sea otters are among the most charismatic marine mammals and are often found carrying rocks for use in opening their prey. They find food under rocks on the bottom of the ocean floor and along the shoreline where they forage on mussels, clams, crabs and urchins. \nSea otter fur is the densest of any marine mammal and has as many as one million hairs per square inch. Because they have no blubber, otters are constantly grooming themselves to keep themselves warm in the cold oceans they inhabit. Otters paws have claws that turn backward and they use them as a “comb” to keep the hairs separated, blowing air into their coats to enhance the warmth. \nWhile oil spills are harmful to all sea life, the sea otter is especially vulnerable because they are dependent on a pristine coat for their warmth. As a keystone species, otters keep the environment in balance. They are often the dominant species that keeps lesser species from taking over. They are also an indicator of the health of the oceans they inhabit. If the otters are not surviving on the food they consume, then neither will the humans who eat the same type of food.\nPopulations of sea otters are declining in some areas while other areas are stable at the moment, but due to human impact they live on a precipice of extinction. Today the southern sea otter as well as some populations of the Northern sea otter, is listed as a “threatened population” and it is up to us to take the necessary steps to protect the environment in which they live in order to protect the environment for all of us.\nThis image was taken with a Nikon D4. \nTo see another image of this otter, check out @joelsartore!\n.\n.\n#otters #NOTAPET #cute #seaotters #adorable #otter #cuteanimals #sealife #marinelife #marinemammals #nature #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22794257_158404541427250_3649464978773114880_n.jpg"},

Adults can grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) and females have been known to live for more than 20 years. Their entire body is covered in rosy hairs, which serve as their most important sensory inputs. Certain hairs contain temperature or smell receptors, while others are able to detect airborne vibrations. These tarantulas are capable of launching the barbed hairs on their underbelly toward predators which can cause burning and irritation (especially when breathed in) and buy them time to escape.

This butterfly is also known as the “checkered butterfly” because of its distinctive wing pattern, or the “citrus swallowtail” because of its propensity for the sweet juices of oranges, grapefruit, and lime. The lime butterfly is the most populous and widely spread of the swallowtail family and has a strong preference for citrus. It pollinates all species and varieties of native and imported citrus trees all over the world. In fact, this pollinator does its job so well, it’s even considered a pest in most citrus nurseries. As the eggs laid on the undersides of leaves hatch, the caterpillars dine on and defoliate them. However, without the work these butterflies do to pollinate, citrus plants would inevitably struggle.\nFollow @joelsartore for more incredible species!\n.\n.\n#pollinatorhero #pollinators #gardening #nature #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark"},

Thousands  of baby sturgeon, a threatened species in our waters, were released into the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries this week to rebuild struggling populations that were wiped out by overharvest and construction of dams. Sturgeon are called dinosaur fish because they are ancient freshwater fish that swam with ichthyosaurs in Mesozoic waters 230 million years ago. These finger sized lake Sturgeon could live to 100+ years and grow to 7 feet long , the females will not reach sexual maturity for 20+ years. The Sturgeon group of fishes are the largest freshwater fish on the planet. There are 27 species of sturgeon, the largest and most rare is the beluga called  Huso huso that can reach 2500+ pounds and 20+ feet. Sturgeon are one of the most threatened species on earth because of the market and poaching demand for their eggs called caviar. A single 100 yr + female with eggs is worth a million dollars or more on the black market. Many populations in Europe are gone or hanging  by a thread.

During this trip I was struck by the indigenous stewardship to the land, from the elders to the seventh generation water protectors, of taking responsibility for what we are taking out of and putting into the earth, actively keeping track of it as a community and actively fighting for it.

The fellowship focuses on Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species and kicks off with these five unique creatures: the Antillean manatee (photographed at the @Dallas_World_Aquarium), Baird’s tapir (photographed at @theomahazoo), the giant anteater (photographed at the Caldwell Zoo), the hawksbill turtle (photographed in Xcaret, Mexico), and the volcano rabbit (photographed at the Chapultepec Zoo). These species are the subject of conservation efforts by our first fellowship candidates in Latin America. Each species has been featured in the National Geographic Photo Ark, a flagship program of the National Geographic Society founded by National Geographic photographer @JoelSartore. Once selected, the final Photo Ark EDGE fellows will undertake a 2-year fellowship project to help protect their focal species. The fellowships will leverage the power of Sartore’s captivating portraits to bring attention to the global extinction crisis and will help put effective tools in the hands of conservationists working to turn the tide for species at risk.

The delta is an intricate tapestry of dry land and wet land, with ever shifting boundaries defined by the ebb and flow of water. Fed by a river that begins a thousand miles away in the highlands of Angola, the delta spreads out across the Kalahari Desert sands of northern Botswana. The miracle of water in the desert attracts multitudes of animals from antelopes to elephants. The delta became a World Heritage Site in 2014, but its future is by no means secure.

When encountering a large predator in nature, these owls will attempt to blend in with their environment by pulling their feathers inward and narrowing their eyes to slits in order to appear more like a broken tree branch.

In situations where an owl needs to analyze its surroundings, their extremely flexible necks compensate for their lack of eye movement. Owls can rotate their heads 270 degrees around and almost upside down in order to check its surroundings.","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22634597_382458448858313_4311020517952847872_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22594335_1476989462384913_4375141514938941440_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22594335_1476989462384913_4375141514938941440_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

This little bat is thought to have the fastest metabolism of all mammals, similar to that of the hummingbird. In a single day, this bat can use up to 50% of its stored fat! The Pallas long-tongued bat earned its name for one reason: it has a specially evolved tongue that makes collecting nectar a breeze. When the bat extends its tongue, blood rushes into the area and expands special hair-like barbs on the bat's tongue, causing these barbs to stand upright. The barbs function like a mop and allow the bat to pull a great amount of nectar into its mouth in a very short amount of time, making it a highly efficient snacker. Indeed, it lives almost entirely off of nectar and pollen but is known to eat pieces of fruit and insects as well. Its quest for nectar results in the transport of a great amount of pollen from one flower to the next on its fur and snout, allowing it to pollinate as many as 34 different species of fruits and flowers. Many plant species also rely on this bat for seed dispersal when they pass through the droppings, allowing reseeding that's automatically fertilized in the process.\n.\n.\n#bats #bat #pollinatorhero #pollinator #nature #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22430398_161550741096626_7157764789232467968_n.jpg"},

The uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front. The complex had three walls with ramparts, each with towers providing a protected space for defense personnel. The first wall was 7m (23ft) high, the second, 14m (46ft) and the third wall, which covered all four sides, was 27 metres (89ft) in height. \nNo presence of the wall exists in modern times. \nUNESCO declared the ruins of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979\n\nFollow @simonnorfolkstudio for updates, outtakes, unpublished and archive material.\n\n@natgeo @simonnorfolkstudio\n\n#documentaryphotography #simonnorfolk #archaeology #iran #Persian #Persianempire #Persepolis #shah #Achaemenid #Achaemenidempire #history #heritage #worldheritage #worldheritagesite #shiraz #fars #wall #defence #defense #party #worldparty #simonnorfolkstudio #documentary #igtravel #visualarchitects @simonnorfolkstudio #unesco @unesco","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22430511_133819300675224_7603640767457787904_n.jpg"},

The species has highly specific marsh habitat requirements and has faced diminished habitat quality and reduced water availability associated with water use and climate change. At one point, the total population size was thought to be less than 200 Amargosa voles in the world, and now they are estimated at about 500-- 100 of which are in a breeding colony at the @UCDavisVetMed school.\nIn the wild, these voles typically only live 3-4 months because they succumb to predation, but in the colony, some voles have lived more than 2 years. The ad hoc Amargosa vole team with membership and support from CDFW, @mypubliclands, and @usfws rears this species in captivity to learn more about them, provide an insurance colony against extinction in the wild, and to serve as a source for reintroduction.\nIn September, 2017, a lightning strike initiated a fire that wiped out two marshes and the voles within them. Although other nearby marshes still support voles, this incident highlights how precarious their situation is in nature.\nCheck out @joelsartore for a portrait of one of these adorable voles.\n.\n.\n#voles #vole #rodents #endangeredspecies #rare #amargosavole #cute #adorable #science #biology #veterinarymedicine #nature #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22468472_181734715729665_121559600385228800_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22459996_176314539586588_290960519358054400_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22459996_176314539586588_290960519358054400_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

It’s been a few years now, I don’t remember well; maybe she had made that motion of turning to exhale her cigarette smoke a time or two before, and I was watching and waiting. Could be. Looking for pictures is always a little bit like hunting: watching and waiting. When she turned this time, her eyes and mine met just as I raised the camera.

In particular, in this area of Kenya, it is part of the everyday meal and it is at the base of almost any recipe. It is always eaten together with something else: meat, vegetables, fish and so on… \nThe first thing to prepare for our recipe is the orgali: Bring to boil a bit less than a litre of water with some salt. When it boils, add 500 gr of white corn flour, pouring them in the pot a bit at a time and stirring continuously until you obtain a dense mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes, turn the gas off and then let it cool. \nNow you need to prepare meat and vegetables:\n-  Chunk the goat meat into small pieces (about 3cm). Take the skin off the leg of the goat and strip the flesh from it. Put the meat in some water with salt. -  Melt the cow’s fat in a saucepan and when it starts to fry, add two tomatoes chopped in cubes. -  As soon as the tomatoes go mushy and create a sauce, add the chunks of meat and all the sukuma (cut in stripes). -  Let everything cook for about 40 minutes. Taste it to see if you need more salt and add some if necessary. \nWhen meat and vegetables are cooked, place them on the same dish with the ugali, as you can see in the photo. \n#food #kenya #africa"},

When I arrived, they have to tie me here. Once I even cut my ties and I fled, but I was caught... I was chained. God’s servants came to pray for me morning and night, and I felt myself better and better every day. I was chained for a month and I calmed down. But it’s three months now since I live here in this prayer camp.. now I’m fine by the prayers, and I live here waiting to go back home very soon.” Kandjine Laré and his wife Kiname, are farmers who came to The Pentecostal Church of Bokiccenag in Northern Togo seeking ‘healing’ through prayer. He attributes his improvement to the prayers he received at the camp: “If there was no one to save me I’ll be dead now. It is through this camp that I am saved.” Northern Togo is one of the poorest regions in a poor country. Many mental health professionals point to poverty as a contributing factor to mental health problems. \nToday, October 10th, is World Mental Health Day. One in four of us will live with a mental health problem in our lifetime but many of us will have greater options for care than Laré. Learning he was in chains was distressing. So is that fact that he had nowhere else to go.\n\n#InMyWorld is a campaign designed to expose the challenges faced by people living with mental health issues and give them the chance to be seen, heard and valued.

The Mary river is famous for having the highest density of saltwater crocodiles in the world. On a 30 minute boat ride down some stretches of this river you can easily spot several dozen very, very large saltwater crocodiles. What I love about this video though is that it shows how perfectly crocodiles move through the water. Notice the only disturbance to the water is the small bow wave created by the crocodiles snout? Australians joke that they know a crocodile is big when it creates a bow wave when swimming. The reason they create such little disturbance when swimming is partly because the little ridges on their backs, called scutes, create cross currents that cancel each other out, allowing them to be the ultimate masters of stealth. I like to think of wildlife as super heroes, because they can do so much we can't. \nExcited to be returning to this place I love so much in November for a new project with National Geographic. \nFor more details on this new project on crocodiles with Nat Geo follow me @tbfrost \n#crocodiles #crocs #saltie #australia #northernterritory #dinosaurs","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22428707_1948827752072726_6791261017818005504_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22430811_276802116141358_6971098514046582784_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22430811_276802116141358_6971098514046582784_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

The Conservation Clubs aim to connect children to their environment teaching them to understand the relationships between wildlife, their landscape, and their lives. All the children live in pastoral communities with a long tradition of using the environment to sustain themselves and their herds. However, increasing numbers of people and livestock have put pressure on the environment and wildlife.

Mpala is strongly committed to using research to benefit the surrounding communities, the nation of Kenya, and global conservation efforts as a whole. Mpala hosts multiple educational outreach programs in order to tackle issues of human-wildlife conflict and thus ensure that both conservation and human-livelihood goals are met. Furthermore, Kenya actively supports the involvement of Kenyan nationals in this process, and Kenyan scientists are a vital part of the research conducted at Mpala.\n\nIf wildlife is to survive at all, it’s vital that we allow those who live alongside the wildlife that we prize so dearly, to both share in it’s incredible beauty, and any income and benefits generated from it.\n\nTo see more of my work and projects follow me here @chancellordavid @natgeo and The Mpala Research Centre @mpalalive #wildlife #conserving #conservation #stoppoaching @everydayextinction #fightingextinction #endextinction #elephant #ivory #rhino #northernkenya #Kenya #africa @princeton_university @kenyawildlifeservice @smithsonian @kinetic_six @hellokiosk @sandiegozoo @exploreorg @annenbergfdn"},

Though appearing cute and soft, this pollinator is packing some major heat. The velvet ant is actually a wasp with very painful bristles that feel nothing at all like velvet to its attackers. It isn't just pokey, either: its sting is so painful that it is often referred to as the “cow killer”, though that's an exaggeration. It also releases a very alarming squeak when threatened that’s created by moving sections of its abdomen in and out very quickly and scraping its body with a tooth-like projection. This sound is not only unpleasant to hear, but also feels like a mini-jackhammer in the mouth of any unfortunate predator that decides the velvet ant looks like a tasty snack. In addition to its sharp spines and unpleasant noises, the velvet ant has one final defense mechanism: odor. This insect can release special chemicals called ketones that work to deter predators and can even trigger alarm behavior in other predatory ants, causing them to scatter in fear and retreat from the velvet ant. Though parasitic in nature and feeding primarily on larvae of the sand fly and other wasps, adult velvet ants drink nectar and pollinate many species of flowers. Now that’s a well-adapted pollinator!\n.\n.\n#pollinatorhero #ant #strangeanimals #defensemechanism #velvetant #insects #nature #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22280656_1832082237102901_8821548155205058560_n.jpg"},

The meat derived from the hunt, a vital form of protein to these remote villagers, was shared with the surrounding villages. They are participants in CAMPFIRE, a program of long standing in which rural groups sell access to their wildlife in return for some of the profit. Once a model of its kind, CAMPFIRE now gets mixed reviews: Too often the money earmarked for communities doesn’t reach them or get spent on local improvements.\nThe earliest evidence of an elephant having been killed by human hands dates back to a blue-mud swamp in Siberia nearly 14,000 years ago. The spine of a woolly mammoth found at the confluence of the Ob and Irtysh Rivers seems to have been penetrated by a man-made weapon that left flake traces of stone inside one of the vertebrae. The tusks, we might imagine, weren’t displayed in a trophy room back at the hunter’s cave. But hunting is more than a quid pro quo for sustenance. At some moment in our dawning consciousness, hunting became equated with status, virility, and power. Assyrian carvings from 650 B.C. depict lions being released from cages for slaughter by a chariot-riding king. The Maasai have long killed lions as a rite of passage.\n\nWith more than half the planet’s population living in cities, our relationship with the wild has become increasingly divorced from our everyday reality. We’re now less a part of that wild world from rain forest to veld than consumers of it. Yet if we eat meat or wear and use leather products, we too are hunters of a sort.\nFrom work featured in October issue of @natgeo follow me there, and @chancellordavid to see more of my work and projects #wildlife #conservation #conserving #nopoaching #africa #elephant #ivory #rhino #fightingextinction"},

By 1973, trapping, poison and rifles had completely eliminated the wild Mexican gray wolf populations in the U.S., leaving only a handful alive in captivity.\nTo save this keystone species, an unprecedented breeding program was put in place and, in 1998, eleven Mexican gray wolves were eventually released back into the wilds of Arizona. Today about 100 survive on their own, a better number for sure, but the wolf still remains one of the rarest land animals on Earth.\nSo what to do? Allowing the wolves to establish territories in many suitable habitats in remote locations will help prevent inbreeding. Biologists hope to target areas with abundant wild prey and few roads such as the vast forested areas around the Grand Canyon, up into Utah, over to New Mexico and into parts of Colorado. A minimum population of 750 wolves in the wild would help ensure that the species will stay genetically distinct enough to survive well into the future.\nCheck out @joelsartore to see another image of this beautiful wolf.\n.\n.\n#wolves #mexicangraywolf #lobo #lobos #wolf #AmericanSouthwest #Arizona #Newmexico #Texas #mexico #rare #endangeredspecies #endangered #rareanimals #conservation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22280832_120610275292726_2159818265793134592_n.jpg"},

Civita was the birthplace of Saint Bonaventure, who died in 1274. The location of his boyhood house has long since fallen off the edge of the cliff. By the 16th century, Civita was beginning to decline, becoming eclipsed by its former suburb Bagnoregio. At the end of the 17th century, the bishop and the municipal government were forced to move to Bagnoregio because of a major earthquake that accelerated the old town's decline. At that time, the area was part of the Papal States. In the 19th century, Civita's location was turning into an island and the pace of the erosion quickened as the layer of clay below the stone was reached in the area where today's bridge is situated. Bagnoregio continues as a small but prosperous town, while Civita became known in Italian as La città che muore (\"The Dying Town\"). Civita has only recently been experiencing a tourist revival - The town is noted for its striking position atop a plateau of friable volcanic tuff overlooking the Tiber river valley. It is in constant danger of destruction as the edges of the plateau collapse due to erosion, leaving the buildings to crumble as their underlying support falls away. As of 2004, there were plans to reinforce the plateau with steel rods to prevent further geological damage. The town was placed on the World Monuments Fund's 2006 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites, because of threats it faces from erosion and unregulated tourism. #civitadibagnoregio #italy #erosion #oldtown","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22158838_708351806024401_2902778364538388480_n.jpg"},

I’m delighted to share a 360 video I was able to create with baby pandas in Chengdu, China which you can find on @natgeo. It was a privilege to spend time with this very rare, finicky, endangered animal. As soon as I put the 360 degree cameras in the enclosure, the six month old bears would immediately find them and attack! They also loved to climb up my legs and extracting their teeth and claws was sometimes painful but well worth it. It’s hard to imagine, but these animals were once as mythical and elusive as Bigfoot. They have been around for millions of years, but were only made known to the western world within the last century. The first panda was captured alive only in 1936. \nWith only a few thousand in the world, and a national symbol for the Chinese, getting close, without interfering with their biology and conservation, and in a way that is acceptable to their understandably protective minders, was challenging. And in a region where bad environmental news is common, the Giant Panda might prove to be the exception and a testament to the perseverance and efforts of Chinese scientists and conservationists. By breeding and releasing pandas, augmenting existing populations, and protecting habitat, China may be on its way to successfully saving its most famous ambassador and in the process put the wild back into an icon.

Beryle truly loves Paris and knows the city far better than I. He was in town for a while, and we had decided to go to the wine bar Les Fous d’en Face for what was billed as “the first annual running of the Camembert.” This proved to be a contest in which rounds of Camembert were placed on a tilted sheet of aluminum; heat from a small blowtorch was applied to the underside of the sheet, and lo, the individual cheeses would begin to run, sliding slowly, very slowly, downward. Music was then played, and most of the people present seemed to enjoy it far more than Beryle and I.\n\nWe decided to leave and walk down Rue de Rivoli to La Tartine, where more than 60 wines are available by the glass. Just as we arrived, the darkened sky gave way with a tremendous downpour of rain. And then, with the rain still falling heavily the sun came out, and the light was brilliant and the color of champagne. I stood in the doorway of La Tartine, looking out over the empty terrace tables. A student passed by, a portfolio under her arm. Across the avenue a man dashed through the rain for cover.

Ethiopians on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem, on Thursday before Easter. At present, the most serious discord in the Holy Sepulchre is between the Ethiopians and their long-time antagonists, the Copts of Egypt. Though the two ancient African churches share a similar dogma, for the last three centuries they have been feuding over the Chapel of St. Michael leading from the parvis (the entrance courtyard) to the roof of the basilica. Initially the Ethiopians controlled the modest chapel, measuring about eight by 11 metres. Unable to pay their Ottoman taxes, the Ethiopians sold the shrine to the Copts in the 17th century. But unwilling to abandon their claim, the Ethiopians built a tiny village atop the church in a space which may have ben a Crusader-era dining room. The monastery (which in their faith includes men and women) is called the House of Sultan Suleiman in honour of the marriage of King Solomon to the Queen of Sheba, a union which they believe led to the founding of their nation 3,000 years ago. Although the Ethiopian monks have lived there for more than 200 years, the Copts are in overall control of the monastery. The Ethiopians represent the first Christian country in Africa. This Church, with its Alexandrian origins, is distinguished by its having preserved Old Testament customs such as circumcision and the Levitical laws governing food and ritual purity, and celebrations in the ancient Ge’ez language. At Easter many Ethiopian men and women come to Jerusalem, cloaked in white stoles.\n\nFollow @simonnorfolkstudio for updates, outtakes, unpublished and archive material.\n\n@natgeo @simonnorfolkstudio\n#photojournalism #documentaryphotography #simonnorfolk #jerusalem #christianity #religion #faith #holyland #orthodoxchurch #simonnorfolkstudio #igtravel #visualarchitects #ethiopia #ethiopian #christians #pilgrims #faithful #traditions #culture #holysepulchre","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21980961_1986661721613905_4393191995468677120_n.jpg"},

Happy Sea Otter Awareness Week!! Warning: Graphic Video.  Sea otters are adorable but they are much more important than their looks. They are indicators of a changing ocean. Two years ago, while in Homer Alaska, I photographed dozens of sea otters that slowly died from paralytic shell fish poisoning. 79 died in one month alone.  The water warmed over 3.5 degrees F in 2014/2015 and with that slight increase in temperature, many species started to suffer.  Sea otters, sea lions, seabirds and many other species had large die-offs from toxic algae.  It is much more than protecting the cute and the cuddly. We must protect entire ecosystems from the microbial life to the megafauna. How do we do that? We must find a way to decrease a global carbon footprint. What are some of the ways that you think we can achieve this.  #followme on @paulnicklen to see what a healthy and cute sea otter looks like.  #turningthetide with @sea_legacy #seaotter #climatechangeisreal #bethechange #nature #reduceyourfootprint","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22072328_117259555634160_3647499936745914368_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":360,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22080066_1977589372457412_3455449520622534656_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":360,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/22080066_1977589372457412_3455449520622534656_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

The members of the conservancy are also often given cash incentives to keep these water points functioning. They are totally independant of outside government assistance.\nCurrently, approximately 14% of Namibia is designated as protected areas, which is equivalent to 112,000 km². Adding the protected communal conservancy lands brings the total to 192, 000 km² of land under some protection. Some exist under an unsystematic figuration design, but 17 of the 29 conservancies (inc Nyae Nyae) actually lie adjacent to the government’s protected area networks. This then increases the continuity between protected areas and result in migration routes for elephants and other large range animals. In addition to direct income, the community gains approx 3 tons of meat from each sucessful hunt. The hunter leaves with ivory, cape (skin), and the feet of the elephant. The current quota for elephant in the conservancy is 5 mature trophy bulls, and 4 non trophy bulls per year. \nAs a result of these conservancies, there are many instances in which wildlife populations are on the rebound. Poaching has decreased dramatically, and is most likely due to the shift in the perceived value of wildlife. The conservancy members now see that the sustainability of the wildlife is important for providing economic development in game hunting and ecotourism, and often game guards are employed to protect the wildlife from poaching. Animals such as elephants, oryx, buffalo, Hartmann’s zebra, springbok and lion, are once again providing biodiversity to the country of Namibia. The black rhino population has recovered to become one of the largest free-roaming herds, and the cheetah population the worlds largest at 2500 #wildlife","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21980714_1460063514072426_4152404566802956288_n.jpg"},

This furry pollinator is native to Central and South America, and is a member of the Procyonidae family, making it a distant cousin of the Raccoon. The kinkajou has ankles that can rotate 180 degrees which allows it to run very quickly down trees to evade predators like the harpy eagle. The kinkajou is often known as the “honey bear” due to its habit of raiding beehives for their honey, much to the dismay of the bees. Its short, coarse fur is natural protection against angry bee stings. When not raiding hives, its five-inch tongue allows it to easily dip into the flowers of fruit-bearing trees in the rain forest. This long tongue coupled with an insatiable sweet tooth makes the kinkajou a valuable pollinator for many fruits and flowers in the rain forest. Though classified basically as a carnivore, the kinkajou will go from flower to flower, drinking nectar, and spreading the pollen on its fur to the next tasty snack.

She was participating in \"Fistula Camp\" at the Aberdeen Women's Center in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Obstetric fistula is one of the most devastating and serious childbirth injuries and is the result of extreme pressure and tissue damage during prolonged or obstructed labor.  When the fetus cannot fit through a mother’s pelvis due to her small stature stature, and if a Caesarean section delivery is not available to end the ordeal, the baby is usually stillborn and a fistula — or abnormal opening between the vagina and rectum or bladder — forms, resulting in severe incontinence. In many cases, like Kadiatu’s, women and girls can also experience peroneal nerve injury, resulting in leg weakness, foot drop and difficulty in walking. Those who attended the camp underwent surgeries to repair their fistulas, treat their decreased mobility, and improve their self-esteem.\n\nThis image is part of a 175-image exhibition titled “Too Young to Wed,” which is the inaugural exhibition at the new L’Arche du Photojournalisme, atop at the prestigious Grand Arche de la Defense in Paris, France.

This owl’s rescuers suspected that she had accidentally consumed poisoned prey and was nearing death upon her arrival at the rehabilitation center. Every hour she received medication and meals until she was healthy again. Eventually, she became strong enough to safely be released back into the wild.\nBarn owls are the most widespread of any owl species, thriving on six continents and on many islands. This bird’s ghostly appearance, eerie call, and habit of roosting in places like church belfries and abandoned buildings has provoked a lot of negative superstition. However, since barn owls prey mainly on rats and mice, their presence has actually proven to be quite beneficial for some. Barn owls have very soft feathers, which help them fly silently while on the hunt. Their ears are lopsided on the sides of their heads, one higher than the other, which helps them to triangulate the sound made by prey, and detect its exact location, even in total darkness.\nIl Futuro della Biodiversita Locale’s goal is to collect, rehabilitate and release animals back into the wild. Since late 2016 they’ve collected over 300 animals and released more than 80. The organization involves teenagers in the release of the recuperated animals to help them become aware of the importance of caring for the environment. For more about this conservation program, follow @ilfuturodellabiodiversita and @greenteenteam.\nIn order to help save the lives of barn owls near you, always use chemical-free, non-toxic rodent control.\nCheck out @joelsartore to see an image of another barn owl and learn more about these majestic creatures.\n.\n.\n#owls #barnowls #birds #owl #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21968395_180136089214531_1947304336254042112_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21929832_755454404634017_4592165181613670400_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21929832_755454404634017_4592165181613670400_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

It will be dug up about a week later when the muscles around the tusks have receded. The hunter will take the tusks home, while the meat, and a portion of the fee will go directly to community members, and to fund for conservation projects to protect the area’s wildlife. There is a trophy hunt limit of five elephants a year in Nyae Nyae representing real money, and a vital source of protien to the San.\n\nSeen from the air Africa can appear as an illusion, rich velds and dramatic rifts, wide deserts and thundering rivers, these seemingly vast stretches of unfettered, unpopulated wild ostensibly forgotten by time and people. At a glance, it could be a repository for all our ideas about wilderness at its wildest. And yet today no patch here goes unclaimed, whether it’s marked, monetized, or fought over. The animals that roam the land have become commodified, part of a new consumerism, marketed and sold, their brands pitted against each other, their continued existence now a question of human demand, whim, and calculation. Wild game is the continent’s version of crude oil—and it too will run out someday. Revenues of hundreds of millions in federal excise taxes levied on hunters go directly to wildlife management and related activities each year in the U.S. alone. And anyone who keeps a freezer full of venison is likely to tell you that the act of killing your own dinner in the wild is more humane than buying the plastic-wrapped meat of industrially raised livestock. This hugely complex relationship that exists between man and animal, the hunter and the hunted, has always been one of the most difficult to navigate; we need to create a space for much needed dialogue, we can not, and should not simply turn away.

I was filming it in slow motion with my phone, mesmerized by its staggering beauty, when I guess it decided the phone looked appetizing and began pecking at it! I immediately left it alone after this as it was obvious it wasn't a fan of phones , people, or thought the phone was food - and I didn't want to disturb it. Now onto more important information: It grows about 3 feet tall and is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is the national bird of Uganda and is one of two crane species that can roost in trees thanks to a long hind toe. My favorite thing about this crane though Is the light colored eyelid that closes as the crane pecks at my phone. Can you see it? That is called a nictating membrane , it is an inner eyelid that closes when the bird thrusts its head underwater to catch a fish or other prey items. It protects the eye and allows the crane to see underwater. Why I really like this is that it shows cranes and many other birds are closely related to crocodiles, my favorite animal and the subject of my latest work for nat geo. \nThis crane was in captivity as part of an important conservation breeding program. \nTo see another video of this beautiful bird\nfollow me @tbfrost","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21904843_1974886812755494_6763115358392942592_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21968450_1293210354122707_7721132763230765056_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21968450_1293210354122707_7721132763230765056_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

When they’re young, these birds have a fully brown plumage and don’t develop the white feathers on their heads for another four or five years. During courtship, bald eagles display an incredible aerial dance wherein they grasp each other by the talons and spin in mid-air. After this strange display, those who mate will stay together for their entire lives, which can last up to 38 years! The two eagles will work together to build their record-breaking, 4.5 foot wide nests, and even take turns incubating their eggs.\nBald eagles are a true conservation success story. They were once abundant in the United States, but when European settlers arrived, their numbers dropped drastically. In 1940 Congress passed an act to protect them, and though the act was helpful in protecting eagles, their populations didn’t really start to grow again until the early 1970s when a deadly insecticide called DDT was finally banned. In 2007, bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list and there are now about 9,700 nesting pairs in the lower 48 states.\nThis bald eagle was photographed at Raptor Recovery at @fontenelleforest where injured and orphaned birds of prey are rehabilitated in Nebraska.\nTo see a portrait of a bald eagle, check out @joelsartore.\n.\n.\n#baldeagle #eagles #birds #ealge #biodiversity #animalrehabilitation #animalfacts #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20224327_1777285329230641_8720245136711221248_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21906400_1425053937572187_2110492219960983552_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21906400_1425053937572187_2110492219960983552_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

The women go by foot and they drag their clam rakes across the sandy bottom. Buried in the sand and growing in the shallow waters of the estuary, the cockles have been protected by a ban that shelters them for several months in which no harvest is allowed and the small bivalves are allowed to reproduce and grow.  Once the ban is lifted, the men and women of this small medieval-old village will converge every morning in the shallow waters for 3 hours a day, every day for 3-4 months to make a living from this delicious bivalve.  This is an age old practice that has ensured the sustainable harvest of this small clam, but few places execute it more perfectly than Noia, where the community works together; the participation of women is valued; and the cockles are healthy, big, delicious and very, very valuable. \nAl abrir la veda de berberecho, cientos de mujeres van a pie a cosecharlo, mientras que los hombres van en barco.

Did you know that there are more than 5,000 species of ladybug in the world? These industrious pollinators are highly desired by gardeners and farmers alike, as they feed on pests such as mites, mealybugs, and aphids. The name \"ladybug\" was coined by farmers in Europe during the Middle Ages who prayed to the Virgin Mary when pests began eating their crops. After ladybugs came and wiped out the invading insects, the farmers named them \"beetle of Our Lady.\" This eventually was shortened to \"lady beetle\" and finally \"ladybug”. Even today, many gardeners order ladybugs as a natural way to combat pests and improve crop yields. In addition to fighting pests, these beetles secondarily feed on both pollen and nectar, and thus pollinate many different kinds of flowering plants and legumes.","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21689899_1403598249756686_4106011747410771968_n.jpg"},

Their jaws slam shut with incredible power, anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds per square inch, perfect for grabbing prey and holding on and crushing bone. Across their legs and backside they have both osteoderms and scutes. The osteoderms are a bone filled scale that forms an almost impenetrable armor. The scutes, also formed with bone, help protect the crocodile but, as one of my instagram followers reminded me, serve another purpose: their design and formation on the back of the crocodile create cross currents that cancel each other out which is why when they swim it barely disturbs the surface of the water. And then we have their tails, pure muscle so strong it can propel a crocodile completely out of the water! like this one on the Adelaide river in the Northern Territory of Australia. \nThere is so much more to share about crocodiles and why they are perfectly designed for what they do: their eyes, even their stomach acid!

Mosaics at the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem: The Doubting of Thomas.\nThe Church of Nativity in Bethlehem is the only major church in the Holy Land that survives intact from the early Christian period. The Church of the Nativity was originally commissioned in 327 by Roman emperor Constantine and his mother Helena over the cave that is still traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. The present church was built by the Emperor Justinian after the destruction of the Samaritan Revolt of 529 CE. In 614, the church had a narrow escape. A Sassanian army from Persia had invaded the Holy Land and proceeded to destroy all the churches. However, they desisted at Bethlehem because they recognised the images of their ancestors, the Magi, above the entrance to the Church. \nThe site is currently under restoration within an international project managed by the Palestinians through the Project Client \"The Palestinian Presidential Committee for the Restoration of the Nativity Church\". Work on the mosaics is part of an estimated $19 million makeover -the building hadn't undergone major repairs since 1479. Of the 2,000 meters of original mosaics, only 150 meters squared remains. Mosaics created 155-1169CE\nThe artist, Basilius, signed his name in Latin and Syriac — using tesserae.

This type of injury typically heals poorly, especially with migratory birds and aerial insectivores. While it's unknown how the bird was hurt, most likely she had just returned to Iowa after spending the winter in Central and South America, and was preparing to nest and raise young in Iowa for the summer.\nOne of the most acrobatic of all North American bird species, barn swallows feed on insects almost exclusively in flight, so perfect wings are essential for their survival. After 3 months in rehabilitation, she was finally well enough to be released in mid-August, and is flying free again! Hopefully she will feed well in the Iowa skies and gain some strength over the next few weeks before starting the long journey back south for the winter.\nIowa Bird Rehabilitation (IBR) admits all types of birds year round, from tiny hummingbirds to giant pelicans and everything in between.  As word spreads of the work they do, their patient numbers have increased, and this year IBR expects to take in around 600 birds. The work is all volunteer and they receive no state or federal funding. The goal is simple but challenging: to rehabilitate and release all wild birds that come in.\nTo see a close up portrait of this bird, check out @joelsartore.\n.\n.\n#swallow #birds #barnswallow #animalrehabilitation #biodiversity #animalfacts #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #natgeo #savetogether #photoark","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21732140_2003806526550751_3683520491722637312_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21682927_1900221883565861_3519773549302644736_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21682927_1900221883565861_3519773549302644736_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

Grandmas always know how to cook - Julia Enaigua, 71 years old – La Paz, Bolivia - Julia was born more than 70 years ago in a little village on the shores of the Titicaca Lake. In her family everybody was, and is still now, a fisherman or a farmer. Indeed, she grew up first playing and then working in the fields, too. When she was 25 she got married and moved to La Paz, the city where her husband came from. Since that moment her job has changed: from a farmer into a seller of vegetables. She has got a small stall in one of the many markets in the city. Every day she wakes up very early, takes a bus to go to the countryside outside the city, buys huge bags of vegetables from the local farmers, goes back to the city by bus and, after arranging her stall for the day, she is at the market until she sells almost all the vegetables. Unfortunately, nobody is waiting for her home now, her husband died a few years ago and her children live in another house. However, it’s a pleasure that every weekend they both gather at her house and she can cook for them and her 5 grandchildren. \nQueso Humacha (vegetables and fresh cheese soup) - Ingredients:\n-  8 big haba (green beans similar to fava beans)\n-  two tufts Huakataya\n-  3 ears of white maize -  12 small papa piño -  1 red onion\n-  200 gr salted fresh cow cheese -  oil, salt, chilli powder\n/  First of all, boil the ears of white maize and the papa piño (without peeling them) in some water in two separate pots. Cook them for 40 minutes.\n-  In a casserole, fry half chopped onion with some oil on a low heat. -  Peel the haba beans and add them to the onions. -  After 10 minutes, add some chopped Huakataya and a pinch of chilli powder. Pour in a glass of hot water. -  Check on the cooking point of the beans at times. When you think they are ready, add the cheese which has been diced, and let everything cook for 5 minutes more to melt the cheese. -\tDrain the ears of maize and papa piño. Chop the ears in three pieces and also half the papa piño if you like. Place them on a plate and pour the sauce you have obtained from cooking the cheese and beans on top."},

Much of the ministry of Jesus occurred on the shores of Lake Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The Synoptic gospels of Mark (1:14–20), Matthew (4:18–22), and Luke (5:1–11) describe how Jesus recruited four of his apostles from the shores of Lake Galilee: the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers John and James. One of Jesus' famous teaching episodes, the Sermon on the Mount, is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the lake. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here.\n\nIncreasing water demand in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as dry winters, have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line to dangerously low levels at times.

In California alone, predators of adult and young brush rabbits include snakes, barn owls, great-horned owls, red-tailed hawks, Cooper’s hawks, coyotes, gray foxes, mink, weasels, and bobcats. Once common in California’s Central Valley, the riparian brush rabbit is now endangered. Their plight isn’t that surprising considering the Central Valley is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world, providing more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the U.S.\nTwenty years ago, concerns about the subspecies’ future were so great, that a cooperative recovery effort was initiated. This effort was centered on the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), where this adult male was photographed before he was released back into the wild. The charismatic and shy nature of the rabbit has helped garner millions of dollars to support the conservation program, which included captive breeding and reintroduction.  Another major element was the largest contiguous riparian woodland restoration program in California, the design of which was guided in part by using the brush rabbit as an umbrella species.  Over a 12-year period ending in 2013, about 1,500 captive-bred rabbits were released on NWR lands.  As a result of these measures, the refuge now hosts the largest and most robust population of riparian brush rabbits.\nFor a portrait of this rabbit, check out @joelsartore.\n.\n.\n#riparian #rabbit #wildlife #nature #conservation #endangeredspecies #wildliferefuge #stanstate #usfws #ucdavisvetmed #sacramentozoo #cuteanimals #adorable #wildlifephotography #naturephotography  #animalfacts  #extinctioncrisis #notapet #biodiversity #natgeo  #photoark #SaveTogether","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21579668_160661471155198_4895600605281648640_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21461673_526450254413531_4037866404723032064_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/21461673_526450254413531_4037866404723032064_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

The last recorded sighting of a king cheetah in the wild was in 1986 in the Kruger National Park. They occur naturally in a localised area that covers adjoining portions of Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa (northern and eastern regions of the Limpopo Province). During the 1980s, a number of litters born in captivity contained king cheetah cubs, and since then it has become customary for some of the breeding facilities to focus on sustaining blood lines with the intention of breeding king cheetahs at will. The gene appears to be carried at a low frequency in the wild, and its occurrence is localised. HESC @hesc_endangeredspeciescentre in South Africa has a genetic pool of king cheetah genes that can make it possible to breed king cheetah as colour variant without the intention of breeding the king cheetah for commercial purposes. #stopthetrade #cheetah #stoppoaching #cats #bigcats #southafrica #conserving #conservation #wildlife #wildlifetrade"},

The lesser long-nosed fruit bat has a special relationship with its environment, as it must migrate to stay within areas that contain the blooming plants that provide its nutrition. These areas are usually in longitudinal lines called “nectar corridors”, and the lesser long-nosed bat will travel more than any other bat in order to secure its meals. Unlike other bats that primarily feed on readily available insects in a smaller area, the lesser long-nosed bat has a large foraging area and thus contributes to the spread of genetic diversity of many species of desert plants, including the protected saguaro cactus of the Sonoran Desert. The greatest threat to the lesser long-nosed bat is the conversion of wild land to ranches, agricultural, and urban development. Because it is a nectarivore that travels in accordance with the blooming of desert plants, a great understanding of this bat’s migration patterns in necessary in order for conservation efforts to be truly effective.\nFollow @joelsartore for more incredible species.\n.\n.\n#bat #bats #cute #cuteanimals #adorable #pollinators #pollinatorhero #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #naturephotography #animalfacts #natgeo #photoark #SaveTogether","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21433285_1446222408794917_4859356621811220480_n.jpg"},

Vultures in Africa and Asia have experienced catastrophic declines over the last twenty years. In India and around Asia some species have declined by up to 99% due to the use of a drug called Diclofenac - a drug used to cure some ailments in cows. In Africa a mixture of poisoning both direct and indirect combined with habitat loss and loss of food has contributed to their current steep decline. Vultures are hugely important to eco-systems - they consume more meat on the plains of Africa than all the other predators and scavengers combined. Without them playing such an important role other scavengers such as jackals, feral dogs and hyenas will proliferate and with that will come an increase in rabies - as has been seen already in India with increased incidence of human rabies.

It is today marked by nine Stations of the Cross; there have been fourteen stations since the late 15th century, with the remaining five stations being inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nFollow @simonnorfolkstudio for updates, outtakes, unpublished and archive material.\n\n@natgeo @simonnorfolkstudio\n\n#photojournalism #documentaryphotography #simonnorfolk #jerusalem\n#archaeology #Jesus #religion #faith #holyland #christianity #simonnorfolkstudio #igtravel #visualarchitects #streetphotography #street #pilgrimage #stationsofthecross #stairway #bible #thebible #theholybible @simonnorfolkstudio","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/21224646_302534610221847_6621384993857863680_n.jpg"},

According to Indigenous tribal folklore of the Kiowa and Lakota, a group of girls went out to play and were spotted by several giant bears, who began to chase them. In an effort to escape the bears, the girls climbed atop a rock, fell to their knees, and prayed to the Great Spirit to save them. Hearing their prayers, the Great Spirit made the rock rise from the ground towards the heavens so that the bears could not reach the girls. The bears, in an effort to climb the rock, left deep claw marks in the sides (the marks which appear today on the sides of the Tower), which had become too steep to climb.

BUT if humans think they are so special , that we are smarter than all other creatures , why on earth would this mountain gorilla have picked this camera up and examined it for nearly 10 minutes, pushing every button , curious about each beep and flash of the LCD. Before Jane Goodall's discovery of chimpanzees using tools in the 1960s most people thought animals were dumb, instinct driven robots. Her simple observation shattered the notion humans are the only thinking beings on the planet. And yet - nearly 60 years later - much of the public and many scientists too measure an animals intelligence against our own.  But there are some researchers that think that is the wrong approach. They think the question we should be asking is what do other animals know that we don't. They wonder Is it possible there are creatures on our planet smarter than us, living in worlds we can't even imagine, let alone decipher! I like to think so!

Initially completed in 691 CE at the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik, it was built on the site of a Roman temple, which had in turn been built on the site of an earlier Jewish temple, destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23. The building is in its core one of the oldest extant works of Islamic architecture.\nIn light of the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam, it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world. Since the Crusades, the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site, without interruption.

These magnificent creatures can live to be over 65 years old.\n\nTo see more underwater photography, or to learn more about the story behind this photo, follow me - @BrianSkerry - on Instagram. \n#turtle #cute #climate #change #loggerhead #florida #underwater #photography #photooftheday #conservation #cute #animals #food #natgeo #climatechange","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21147518_1891301927800292_8143388714840621056_n.jpg"},

Because the Karner blue depends on one tiny flower called the wild lupine, their numbers have decreased drastically in the wild. Two generations of these butterflies are born per year in accordance with the blooming of the wild lupine flower, and once hatched, the caterpillars only feed and lay their eggs on the leaves of this special plant. But as the lupine flower decreased as a result of heavy herbicides, fires, and urban development, the Karner blue decreased as well. But conservationists are working to help the species survive. Though still seriously threatened, the karner blue butterfly is slowing making a comeback due to the extraordinary efforts of habitat restoration, rehabilitation, and release programs. @thetoledozoo, where this butterfly was photographed, has pioneered propagation techniques for the Karner blue butterfly beginning in 1998 and the species is now on track to be delisted.\nFollow @joelsartore for more incredible species.\n.\n.\n#butterflies #karnerblue #endangeredspecies #rareanimals #biodiversity #metamorphosis #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #naturephotography #animalfacts #natgeo #photoark #SaveTogether"},

It is also rumored that Vladmir Ilyic Ulyanov may have taken his nickname,  Lenin, from the Lena River when he was exiled to the Central Siberian Plateau. #followme @irablockphoto to see more images from around the world. @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #lenariver #lenin #river #reflections #sky #stillness","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21107281_771600539678931_2927212192967163904_n.jpg"},

More than 100,000 people may have succumbed to Chernobyl-related illnesses.\nIn 2011, the Ukrainian government legalized trips to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which has since become a disaster-tourism destination.

The ambient light changes remarkably fast during the eclipse and I was making a lot of decisions on the fly.

More specifically, open defecation. An uncomfortable topic, but an important one for people, especially children, all over the globe. I spent much of the year awkwardly asking people if I could follow them to the bathroom, whether that was in a house or in a field. \nBottomline: If we don’t have healthy systems for sanitation, we won’t have clean water. \nAbout half of the Indian population defecates outside without using toilets. The result is that children pick up parasites and chronic infections that impair the ability of the intestines to absorb nutrients — causing 117,000 Indian children die each year from diarrhea, according to Unicef. The current Indian government is trying to change this.

It was long thought to be a distinct species, but genetic studies have shown it to be the southernmost subspecies of plains zebra. It is considered particularly close to Burchell's zebra. Its name was derived from its call, which sounded like \"kwa-ha-ha\". The quagga is believed to have been around 257 cm (8 ft 5 in) long and 125–135 cm (4 ft 1 in–4 ft 5 in) tall at the shoulder. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and therefore more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga's behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30–50 individuals. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than Burchell's zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the Karoo of Cape Province and the southern part of the Orange Free State in South Africa.\n\nAfter the Dutch settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. While some individuals were taken to zoos in Europe, breeding programs were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and the Quagga Project is trying to recreate the phenotype of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by selectively breeding Burchell's zebras. They have a rhino too, it's not yet marked 'extinct' - to see more as of my work and projects follow me here @natgeo and @chancellordavid \n#hunters #karoo #southafrica #conserving #conservation #quagga #zebra #extinct #fightingextinction #withbutterfliesandwarriors","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/20838915_742702439263596_782429310597201920_n.jpg"},

This #pollinatormonday features our curious friend from the @LincolnChildrensZoo. The black and white-ruffed lemur is the primary pollinator of the travelers palm, a species of tall, flowering plant native to Madagascar. The lemur will climb the palm, skillfully pry back the sturdy leaves to reveal the flower, and reach its muzzle into the blossom to drink the nectar. The pollen that gets trapped on its fur is then moved along to the next flower. This process simultaneously pollinates the traveller’s palm and nourishes the lemur. Scientists even speculate that the black and white-ruffed lemur and the travellers palm may have co-evolved because they suit one another's needs so perfectly. The traveller's palm is unique in that it produces enough nectar to sustain a pollinator of the lemurs size, and the lemur has the dexterity to open the palm’s sturdy leaves, as well as a long, tapered muzzle perfect for reaching down into the flower.

The 2009 Ngorogoro Wildlife Conservation Act placed new restrictions on human settlement and subsidence farming in the Crater, displacing Maasai pastoralists, most of whom had been relocated to Ngorongoro from their ancestral lands to the north when the British colonial government established Serengeti National Park in 1959. The construction of tourist hotels in the Conservation Area allows people to access \"the unparalleled beauty of one of the world's most unchanged wildlife sanctuaries\", according to a government brochure, even as thousands of Maasai have suffered forcible eviction and have been denied access to water sources for their livestock. #ngorongoro #tanzania #ngorongorocrater #buffalo #africa #wildlife #crater","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/20902486_1831682523813427_1629795661966737408_n.jpg"},

In 1980, the year I was born, a team of British cave explorers embarked on a 3 month expedition to Mulu National Park in Sarawak, Malaysia where they discovered Sarawak Chamber, which for many decades was widely regarded as the world’s largest cave chamber.  The chamber is so big, eight Boeing 747 aeroplanes can fit nose to tail across the width of this vast chamber! Hearing about this for the first time left me mesmerised. For me, photographing pitch black spaces is what I live for, I just love the challenge, and this was literally the biggest challenge of all! \nThis picture is a panoramic photograph of five portrait images blended together showing the lower half of Sarawak Chamber. In 2011, I remember setting up my tripod on a massive rock located on the upper slopes of the giant boulder field. It reminded me of an iceberg, just the top was sticking out above a sea of smaller boulders - who knows how deep it went! I started photographing in the morning, beginning on the left side of the image, where mist and wisps of thin cloud lingered. By the evening, when I had worked my way across to the right of the image, the air was crystal clear. It took over eight hours from when I first opened the shutter to when I closed the shutter to capture this image. It was a long time with just a bag of peanuts! I had five assistants with me, and for each photograph I would reposition them. In some cases this took 40 minutes for the assistant to travel from one position to the next. One photographic assistant thought ahead and brought in a book to read in between shots. Once the assistants were in place, the next challenge was to get the lighting to match the previous photograph so that an even blend would be made when stitching together. For this reason, this is one of the hardest photographs I’ve ever had to take. The whole thing was an epic experience, from the huge size of the chamber, to the epic efforts by the team that made this happen.","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/20759168_1336417229812129_6740658877072670720_n.jpg"},

We were super excited! Our first thoughts were to shout out loud to hear the echo. It took six seconds for the echo from our initial shout to fade, hit the far wall, then bounce back to us. Even though we couldn’t see anything, we knew immediately from the echo that this was a huge room. It was epic! A few days later, we came back and split up into two teams and surveyed around the perimeter walls. From one side of the chamber, I remember looking down several giant piles of rocks and boulders and in the distance we could just see four tiny figures, our teammates mapping the other side. They were several hundred feet away. We had Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd playing from some small speakers in the top of one guys backpack. It was surreal and very epic.

While in its caterpillar phase, the harmonia tigerwing feeds on plants that have a very bitter taste, which then makes the butterfly very unpalatable to birds. The males of this species are also known to frequent the droppings of birds in order to increase their toxicity, and ensure their safety from predators in the sky. The butterfly is so effective at dissuading predators that other species have evolved similar color patterns and behaviors in order to gain protection through mimicry.

You will feel compelled to choose, but you cannot wade across: the water is too deep. And you should not swim: there are too many crocs. Please also do not leave your baggage, for we promise it will vanish before your return. So, what will you do? If you have been around a little while, you understand the joke. There is the boat, or nothing. No one remembers how it got here; possibly an Italian came this far up the Omo and abandoned it. Or a Belgian went downriver and then one night disappeared into the bush. Whatever, the boat is old and unreliable. Some days it runs, some days it doesn’t, one day it’s here and the next it’s gone. We recommend that you don’t bother crossing. Drive on as far as you can, or, better, start walking. You will encounter great oxbows that swallow half a day’s journey, and enormous mosquitoes and herds of wary cattle armed with great horns to fend off lions. This photograph is our way of telling you that really it doesn’t matter which side you're on. Consider the message of geometry—the frond in the boy’s hand, the wake of the boat behind him.

It is never an easy question to answer because it is , to this day, not really clear how it all happened. So I usually say it all starts with an idea and then overdoses of obsession. You have to have a story you want to tell so bad that when you think about not telling the story it makes you crazy, makes you sick. There are a bunch of letters compiled in a book between a young poet and a famous poet, Rainier Rilke , called Letters to a Young Poet. It says the same thing. Don't worry about what editors say or what publishers think or whether this particular idea will make you famous, just pay attention to whether you goto bed thinking about your story and wake up thinking about your story. The one tangible thing I can say helped me start my partnership with National Geographic was a small grant from National Geographic society. It was just $5,000. But it changed my world. I used the money - and raised some more - to explore, map, and photograph caves in the equatorial country of Gabon in west central Africa. This photo is one of the many caves we explored.

Yes it was enormous, but it was also free, and that is a condition never tolerated long. On its slow wander through the North Atlantic the iceberg had come to threaten an oil platform called Hibernia, which sits a few hundred miles from the spot where, in 1912, the Titanic sank. A century later, everyone concerned wanted to avoid another wreck and so the berg was lassoed and tugged away. It takes a lot to budge the big ones, but just a few degrees will do to spare disaster. Look at those blues, all the colors of cold, and imagine the slow dissolve ahead. How long did this one last?

They’re an important part of their ecosystem, and very intelligent. This species is typically found in marshlands throughout Florida, but the populations that live among a few islands in the Lower Keys area of Florida are in the gravest danger. In the long term, sea level rise caused by climate change threatens the wetlands, but in the short term, commercial and residential development is the main cause of decline. Another big problem for these rats is the increased number of raccoons in developed areas of the Keys. Raccoons prey upon silver rice rats, and because so much trash is produced by humans in these areas, raccoon populations have skyrocketed. Protecting this rat’s habitat is an essential first step to conserving the species.\nTo see a portrait of this rat, check out @joelsartore.\n.\n.\n#rats #cute #animalfacts #endangeredspecies #rodents #cuteanimals #wildlife #wildlifephotography #naturephotography #photoark #natgeo #savetogether","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20669473_322029551579294_5749937426579587072_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20639348_117185508930775_2355401271042637824_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20639348_117185508930775_2355401271042637824_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

For most turtles, the sex of the hatchling depends on the temperature of the egg. If the egg was incubated at a warmer temperature, the turtle will be born female. At cooler temperatures they will be born male. Box turtle eggs are slightly flexible and hatchlings like this one can take up to 3 days to fully emerge after they begin the process of hatching. Box turtles have many natural predators, so unfortunately most hatchlings don’t survive in the wild past their first winter. However, if they do, they live an average of 50 years-- many of them making it to over 100!\nTo see a portrait of this baby turtle, check out @joelsartore.\n.\n.\n#turtles #babyturtles #hatchling #egg #hatching #cute #babyanimals #boxturtle #natgeo #photoark #savetogether","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20646194_447597568968150_2473929346071396352_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20640865_101263473917293_6043443474269732864_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20640865_101263473917293_6043443474269732864_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

You take aim, follow, fire. There is a little sound, a little pop. And then you pull in the spear and push the fish down the line, far down and away, as though you didn’t even want him. This is important, because on the reef there are many sharks. If you are a good fisherman, you’ll spear a lot. If you are a good shot, you’ll end up with many fish trailing behind you through the sea. If you have pierced them well there won’t be much blood but they are still moving, wriggling, fighting against the rope, and this is what attracts the big sharks. Imagine it. You are swimming around tugging along a line of bait, and in this line you are the biggest prize! So, you keep pushing the fish down and away. This is what the most experienced men learn. Maybe it's why they are still alive. If the shark comes he may take one, two, three, but let him. Better to be hungry than dead.\n—\nWater. It runs through all of our work.

When completed the telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world at 76.2 m (250 ft) in diameter. Sixty years later it is now the third largest, after the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia, United States, and the Effelsberg telescope in Germany. The Lovell telescope became operational just in time for the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik’s booster rocket by radar. Some 3,500 tons of steel support the dish. Without the annual application of 5,200 litres of weatherproof paint, the telescope on the exposed Cheshire Plain would rust away.

With our money the Russians bought supplies and loaded them into an aging military helicopter—wood stoves, axes, greasy canvas tents, oven mitts stuffed with nails. The dog we brought to frighten bears. It was hard going. What is the tundra but a cold swamp, vicious, beautiful, and grasping? On the last night the expedition leader finally unlocked his supply of vodka and soon all clothing vanished. Then, someone found the flare guns and started shooting up the sky like he was trying to knock out the northern lights, which waved and wailed above us in spirit silence. Was it joy, or madness? Too much time spent in empty country? Suddenly one of the tents burst into flames and the dog, the poor wretched dog, flew out of that collapsing pyre in a howling streak. Men cursed and fell and cried as they chased the flaming creature, their voices thick and slobbery, bodies pale as stars. Finally someone caught it and rubbed the fire from its fur.

Without the political will to back up the imperative of protection and the resources needed to make these places endure for nature and for ourselves, we are not living up to this promise.

Now and then human bones will appear, perhaps even a skull darkly stained during a long residence. Ancestor, neighbor, great-grandmother—don’t worry, doesn’t matter. This land is so old, and time retires all ghosts. Keep digging. With each dry month the water recedes a little farther and soon the hole will be deeper than you are tall.

This giant moth is the largest in North America, with a wingspan of up to six inches. It feeds on leaves and is known to pollinate apple, cherry, and plum blossoms. The lifecycle of this moth is mystifying. After hatching from an egg into a caterpillar, this solitary creature will eat many times its body weight in leaves as it grows. It will then find a safe place to attach its cocoon, such as the the underside of an elder tree leaf. The caterpillar will spin a cocoon of silk fibers where it will form a chrysalis, and develop an entirely new body.\nAlthough it doesn’t look like much is going on, inside the cocoon is a very busy place. The caterpillar's body digests itself from the inside out to rebuild itself. The fluid breaks down the old caterpillar body into cells called imaginal cells, which have the potential to become any type of cell. The new body then forms from those cells, wings and all. This whole process takes about two weeks. When the time comes, fluid will secrete to soften the chrysalis and the fully formed moth will break through the fibers to dry its wings and enter the world. Now that’s a transformation!\nKeep it up with those images of your pollinator gardens, milkweed and monarch images.

I’m constantly aware of the dangers that they face whilst working to protect the wildlife with which we share the planet, but that's not all we ask of them. Poaching can NEVER be done right, but let’s face it when it’s done wrong the results can be even more gruesome. Here an anti poaching unit was called to an elephant mortally injured by poachers; but not killed. After consultation with a vet accompanying the team, a member of the unit was called upon to put an end to the elephants suffering, something that they fight tooth and nail to prevent now rested in their hands. It then remains the duty of the team to remove the ivory from the carcass, take it into custody, and therefore from the poachers grasp.\nOn #worldrangerday I’m looking back at these images and remembering those rangers who on one wet Kenya evening responded to this event and exhibited exceptional bravery, regardless of circumstance.

Carefully and quickly. These elephants are getting moved with their family units to a new park because their numbers have recently thrived in Majete Game Reserve, Malawi - a triumph after nearly going extinct from the reserve just 15 years ago. The process involves a logistical orchestra of specialized veterinarians, dedicated elephants experts, and heavy equipment to tranquilize, quickly crane upside down, wake-up and transport the animals as efficiently as possible, with as little stress as possible. The process involves risk but the threat of ivory poaching and human/ wildlife conflicts are far riskier. @africanparksnetwork plans to complete their two-year translocation of 500 elephants in early August, bringing wildlife back to a another park that was once decimated by poachers, but secure now.

Lemur leaf frogs are highly threatened amphibians living in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. They were once considered a common species in their native habitats, but an amphibian disease caused by the chytrid fungus has decimated the population and they’re now listed as critically endangered by #IUCN. This fungus occurs naturally, but new studies suggest that climate change may be exacerbating the problem. Chytrid dies at around 86 degrees fahrenheit (30d degrees celsius), but rising temperatures have caused more evaporation and therefore more cloud coverage.

In communities outside Zambia’s capital city of Lusaka, Matthias Phiri meets regularly with traditional leaders, faith-based organizations, school and police officials, and other prominent locals to strategize ways to combat child marriage. Members of his ever-growing circle keep an eye out for children who are at risk of getting married and intervene if necessary, pulling vulnerable children out of harm’s way, providing them counseling, re-enrolling them in school and, in some cases, pursuing legal remedies against the perpetrators of child marriage. The biggest challenge, he said, is the discord between the country’s statutory laws, which set the minimum marriage age at 21, and its customary laws, which allow for much greater latitude. In March 2016, the Government of Zambia adopted a five-year national action plan to end child marriage. The Convention on the Rights of the Child recommend counties set a minimum age of marriage to 18 for both men and women.\n.\n\nThis image is part of a 175-image exhibition titled “Too Young to Wed,” which is the inaugural exhibition at the new L’Arche du Photojournalisme, atop at the prestigious Grand Arche de la Defense in Puteaux, Paris.

As farmers become more efficient at eliminating all plants other than corn, beans and wheat from their fields, there are fewer and fewer places for milkweed and nectar-bearing plants to grow. Important pollinating insects like the butterflies and bees need these plants in order to survive. Without these pollinators, we lose much of our ability to grow the fruit and vegetables we eat.\rThat's why it's so important that homeowners step and 'get growing' now in their backyards by planting a pollinator garden, and taking care of lawns and gardens organically. You'll be amazed at the results, and the good feeling you get knowing that you're doing your part in helping to preserve biodiversity right at home. And remember, “organic” means no chemicals should be used on your lawn like pesticides or weed killers. These not only kill plants and animals, but are detrimental to your health too as the chemicals migrate away from your yard and into groundwater. It’s time to get planting, and get natural.

Shooting cultural portraits is something I've become fascinated with recently as a process of interaction and inherently learning more about myself as well as others.  In places like Nepal where I speak the language it's much easier for me but since my Spanish is slim to none, Cuba was much more intimidating.  I'm normally very timid and shy but in these types of situations it takes a sort of 'practiced courage' to connect with a stranger and raise your lens in a way that feels right.  I'd say a third of the folks I approached were not into it and you have to respect that immediately. Most of the time it's nonverbal eye-contact or body language and you would be surprised how many people are actually delighted to give their time for a photo.  Ideally I have time to be in a space for a long time and the subjects become used to my presence before taking a single shot.  Capturing portraits of humanity whether it's your closest loved one or a stranger on the street is a practice that can teach you a lot about yourself. w/ @taylorfreesolo #cuba","media":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/20225211_648812055324534_1338870567498940416_n.jpg"},

Child marriage has long been an issue in Yemen, one of the few countries in the region without a legal minimum age of marriage. Attempts to set 18 as the minimum marrying age collapsed with the outbreak of the conflict in 2015 and it is estimated that, now, child marriage rates could be much higher. A UNFPA-INTERSOS assessment, which interviewed over 250 community members, local leaders and survivors of child marriage for insight into how families are coping with the conflict, stated that most participants “were of the opinion that child marriage has increased in their community. They all stated that the conflict pushed the practice,” according to the assessment’s findings. While more comprehensive assessments are difficult to do in conflict situations, the report also suggests that girls are being married off even younger. Of the child marriage survivors interviewed in the northern part of the country, 72 per cent were married between ages 13 and 15. Of those in the south, 62 per cent were married before age 16.\n.\n\nThis image is part of a 175-image exhibition titled “Too Young to Wed,” which is the inaugural exhibition at the new L’Arche du Photojournalisme, atop at the prestigious Grand Arche de la Defense in Puteaux, Paris.

Makos are one of the fastest fish in the sea, capable of speed bursts of up to 60mph. Of all shark species, they also have one of the largest brains, relative to body size. \nMakos are an endothermic shark, meaning that they can generate heat within their bodies. This adaptation allows them to swim into cooler waters to feed on oily fish, giving them great strength and fueling their powerful muscles. \nThe numbers of Makos have declined worldwide due to overfishing and the increasing gloval demand for shark fins. They are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. \nLearn more about Mako Sharks from the feature story about these impressive animals in the August issue of National Geographic Magazine, @NatGeo.\n\nAnd if you like sharks, or simply find these creatures fascinatinh check,  out the new book - SHARK - by @BrianSkerry and @NatGeo!

On one hand, the majority of migratory bird species need high temperatures and favorable winds in order to use the least amount of their energy during the migration. The mountainous structures of the volcanic system in Mexico cut its coastal plain in half. Migratory birds are not used to flying over these mountainous regions because the winds and thermal currents are not consistently favorable, thus obligating them to continue towards the strait of the coastal plain, which is the only side they can migrate in a concentrated mass.

The milky substance in milkweed actually protects the monarch butterfly from predators by making it toxic to eat. During its caterpillar stage the monarch ingests many times its body weight of milkweed leaves and the toxins are with it throughout its entire life, making its body poisonous to birds and other predators. The orange and black color of the monarch is a warning sign to its predators that the monarch is bad to eat. In fact, the message is so well known in the animal kingdom that other butterflies mimic the color and patterns of monarchs in order to be completely disregarded by their predators. No one wants to eat something poisonous.\nIt’s so important to have milkweed for these graceful butterflies to consume so they can continue to exist on Earth. When you plant milkweed, be sure to keep it away from areas where animals are grazing. Most animals know not to eat milkweed because it produces a very unpleasant smell and tastes awful, but it’s best to keep it out of their reach if possible.\nIn the middle of the U.S., if you have a field that you are wanting to mow containing milkweed, you can protect the butterfly migration by refraining from mowing until at least the third week of September. This way you won’t destroy any monarch eggs on the milkweed, as they already will be hatched and continuing their leg of the migration by this time. For more information on how to plant milkweed and what you can do to help, check out the link in my bio @joelsartore.\nKeep posting images of your pollinator gardens with the hashtag #pollinatorhero!

One by one they were first circumcised and then married off to men more than 30 to 40 years older than them, many of whom were already married to other women. Kulea was somewhat fortunate. Though she was circumcised in preparation for marriage, she had the support of her mother, who championed her education and resisted family pressure to marry her off at a young age.  Kulea has since helped create the @SamburuGirlsFoundation, which rescues girls escaping traditional practices, such as child marriage and female circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation / cutting (FGM/C). “[Our work] is very difficult, because there is no political will or support,” said Kulea, noting that even though the law supports her efforts, the very traditional community adamantly resists any change in these rituals. Earlier this year, Kenya became the 19th country to join the African Union's Campaign to End Child Marriage, which aims to speed up change across Africa by encouraging governments to develop strategies to raise awareness of child marriage and address it’s harmful repercussions. Since then, the effort has attracted a burgeoning roster of child advocates, from government officials and religious authorities to traditional leaders and former child brides—all committed to serving as champions of change in Africa.\n.\n\nThis image is part of a 175-image exhibition titled “Too Young to Wed,” which is the inaugural exhibition at the new L’Arche du Photojournalisme, atop at the prestigious Grand Arche de la Defense in Puteaux, Paris.

My first wildlife job out of college was monitoring the nesting success of spotted owls in Yosemite National Park as part of an ongoing fire fire ecology study. It was 2006 and I drove from Vermont to Yosemite with a used film camera I'd just bought on eBay. I spent the summer learning about what it meant to be a naturalist, about the importance of conserving wild things and wild places and learning from friends along the way. That summer became the foundation for the work that I'm doing now. It has been an immense joy to return and to remember those days.

But be careful , if you itch too hard you might take a tumble. The mosquitoes in the swamp where this was filmed were awful, almost as bad as the far north , places like Canada and Alaska and Greenland, and as you can see they bothered the crocodiles too. This baby saltwater crocodile (crocodylus porosus) is only minutes old, just hatched out of its egg and climbed and clawed its way out of the earthen mound nest its mother made about 90 days earlier. Most saltwater crocodile nests have 40-60 eggs, this one had about that , though only 15 or so ever emerged. And of those 15 it is likely that only 1 will survive to adulthood. The rest will be picked off by birds, snakes, pigs, and even other crocodiles. It is a tough life and northern Australia is a harsh place. In many cases the mother crocodile will guard her nest until the baby crocs hatch. She knows they are ready when they start calling from inside the egg at which point she will help dig them from the nest and even carry them to the water in her mouth. It Is not uncommon for the mother croc to then spend two months with her offspring to protect them. This work was supported by a grant from the National Geographic Society. \n#followme at @tbfrost today to  hear what a baby crocodile call sounds like and to see video of these little crocs swimming around in a shallow pool of water near their nest.","media":{"standard_resolution":{"width":640,"height":359,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20075792_119974475287792_2497831942880231424_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_bandwidth":{"width":480,"height":269,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20075442_500573693620666_1836656134644039680_n.mp4","id":"0"},"low_resolution":{"width":480,"height":269,"url":"https://instagram.fzty2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t50.2886-16/20075442_500573693620666_1836656134644039680_n.mp4","id":"0"}}},

A hyena stalks a young, injured reticulated giraffe at Loisaba Wildlife Conservancy (@loisaba_conservancy) in Northern Kenya. Scientists say the giraffe population continues to decrease, with a little over 95,000 individuals now left in their native habitats. That is a 40 percent drop over 20 years, sparking concern that if the trend continues, these iconic animals could become extinct in the wild within a generation. The decline is believed to be caused by habitat loss and fragmentation coupled with poaching, but because there have been no long-term conservation efforts, it is hard to know what is really happening and how best to inform communities, conservationists and decision-makers. \nSeemingly ubiquitous, it turns out we know very little about giraffe behavior — how they live, where they move and even why their necks are so long. I accompanied conservationist David O'Connor of San Diego Zoo Global (@sandiegozoo) and Dr. Julian Fennessy, director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (@giraffe_conservation), along with veterinarian Mathew Mutinda and a team from Kenya Wildlife Service (@kenyawildlifeservice) as they attached tiny, solar-powered satellite tracker to the ossicone (boney, horn-like structures atop their heads) of 11 giraffes. Knowing which areas are vital to giraffe at different times of year and how they move across the landscape is essential to ensuring their survival.The hope is to use these exciting new insights to assist communities and conservancies at the frontiers of conservation to continue to save these towering icons of Africa. If it works, the horizon may be bright for these giraffe, and the people with whom they share their landscapes.

The Samburu have an ancient connection to elephant, they require elephant dung to marry and consider them sacred. Any Samburu that kills an elephant brings ‘alanna’ a curse upon his family.

Increasingly, animals are pushed into smaller pockets of wilderness, their migration routes closed off, and their water supplies damned and irrigated for crops.

I went to Mongolia to document the miraculous revival of an animal that had vanished from the wild. The fabled Przewalski’s horse was once common across Eurasia, as Ice Age cave paintings testify, but when humans spread, they dwindled. The last wild one was seen in Mongolia in the 1960’s, where it is known as “Takhi”. But a handful of takhis survived in zoos. From that source, Dutch conservationists nurtured a new population in captivity. In a unique airlift, family groups of takhis were transported by cargo plane from the Netherlands to Mongolia, where I joined trucks loaded with groggy horses in crates destined for a national park.\n\nWhen the crates were opened the horses bolted out. They bonded instantly as they took off. I could only expose a few frames before they were out of reach. Yet one of them worked. It celebrates the vitality of an animal wild once more, but it also recalls the images of their ancestors painted many thousands of years ago by anonymous artists on cave walls.

On the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, the rare Trochetia plant is being saved from extinction by this lizard. This plant used to be pollinated by a nectar-sipping bird called the olive white-eye, but sadly the bird is nearly extinct, and now the plant almost entirely relies on this little gecko for pollination and seed dispersal. The shrubby plant does its part by providing the lizard a safe place from predators and providing nourishment through it's colored nectar, then the lizards transfer the pollen on their scales to the next blossom.\nThe phenomena of pollination via lizards has been explored in recent studies, and lizards are now being more widely recognized as pollinators-- especially to island species of flowering plants. Scientists speculate that the high density of lizards on islands due to lack of predation has resulted in fewer insects to feed the lizard population. This has caused a necessary expansion of their diets to include nectar and pollen, thus growing their roles as pollinators. Let’s give it up for the little-known blue-tailed gecko!\rDon’t forget to keep on posting your milkweed and monarch photos with the hashtag #pollinatorhero.
