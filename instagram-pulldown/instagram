Here are some tips:\nPlay with scale and move around to find new perspectives within a single frame. For example, photographing a puddle low to the ground can turn it into an ocean.\nLet props help. A cleverly placed mirror or some sleight-of-hand card tricks can elevate a simple illusion to double take-worthy.\nMake magic by playing with both artificial and natural light. Use a flashlight to draw the eye toward a specific element of an image or incorporate the setting sun‚Äôs long shadows into your illusion.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPillusion hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Here are some tips to get you started:\nCapture moments of pure joy, like a selfie after you've finished a craft or a teammate after they scored the winning soccer goal.\nThink about the different smiles you see in your everyday life, from Mona Lisa smirks to tooth-bearing grins. Take portraits of loved ones and strangers alike whose smiles catch your eye.\nWhen life gets overwhelming, what helps you see through the chaos? Show us the hobbies and activities that make you crack a smile - and tell us why in your caption.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsmile hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/273b2a355ba597678badcc29496cb9b8/5B1AD619/t51.2885-15/e35/26268626_800610116792005_9219028094046699520_n.jpg"},

Stories Highlights is a new part of your profile where you can show more of who you are through stories you‚Äôve shared. And to help you build highlights, your stories will now automatically save into a private Stories Archive so you can easily relive them.\nNow you can group stories into highlights and feature them on your profile. To create a highlight, tap the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù circle, choose stories from your archive, select a cover and give it a name. Your highlight will appear as a circle on your profile that can be played as a stand-alone story.\nMoving forward, your stories will automatically save to your Stories Archive. To see yours, tap the archive icon on your profile, then tap on any story to watch it. From there, you can add it to your current story, share it as a post or add it to a highlight on your profile. Only you can see your archived stories, and you can turn off auto-archiving at any time in your profile settings.\nTo learn more about Stories Highlights and Stories Archive, check out help.instagram.com.

Before he worked as a photographer, Omar studied mime in Europe under French actor Marcel Marceau. ‚ÄúYou can create stories in photography without using words,‚Äù Omar notes, of the connection between his past and present pursuits.\nThese days, he‚Äôs busy bringing visibility to another group of artists: ballet dancers. ‚ÄúWhenever people think of ballet and dance in general, hardly anyone thinks about Latin America. What‚Äôs interesting is that many of the major companies in the world have actually had principal dancers that are from Latin American countries. There is a strong tradition and there is a lot of talent,‚Äù he says.\nFor a closer look at Omar‚Äôs dance photography series, check out our Instagram story.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/79551031491e38f70e47e71a46c19bb4/5B267FB0/t51.2885-15/e35/23595047_357506681370361_7902950071879073792_n.jpg"},

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that showcase light in beautiful and diverse ways, as in this featured photo from Nadia (@laporterouge). Here are some tips to get you started:\nLight transforms ordinary scenes into extraordinary ones. Take a photo of the morning light as it pours into your kitchen, or during a sunset stroll.\nHave an outdoor portrait session with a friend. Try going during the golden hour, or find a perfectly and naturally illuminated wall to use as your backdrop.\nPlay with time and light together by photographing the same subject in the morning, afternoon and evening. Use multi-post to show how the light changes the scene throughout the day.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfindthelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.
